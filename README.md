RESTful API Development and Testing
•	Developed a Flask-based RESTful API for a student management system to handle operations such as:
o	Retrieving student and program data (GET endpoints).
o	Adding new students (POST endpoint) with validation for fields like name, personnummer, and courses.
o	Updating student records (PUT endpoint) with strict validation to prevent changes to immutable fields.
o	Deleting student records (DELETE endpoint).
o	Checking if a student has completed the required courses for a program.
•	Designed endpoints to handle edge cases, such as invalid IDs, malformed inputs, and duplicate records.
•	Tested the API using a comprehensive Postman collection, automating tests for status codes, response times, and data validation.
•	Ensured API reliability and performance by setting response time thresholds and validating JSON/HTML responses.
